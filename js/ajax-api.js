/**
 * AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)
 * ======================================
 * Lets us use JavaScript to request information from separate
 * URLs (make separate HTTP/HTTPS requests) post-initial page-
 * load.
 * Despite AJAX referring to XML, we are /usually/ dealing with
 * JSON-formatted data responses here in 2020.
 * The modern way to make AJAX requests with JS usually entails
 * use of the built-in "fetch()" function/feature.
